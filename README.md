This was my project in Python training. At first it was an Object Oriented project for the same training, but over time we took a small part from the Flask library and converted the project to a backend project and tested it on the site.

The program works as a simulator for a university library so that we can add books and clarify details about these books such as classification, authorâ€™s name, etc. The student here has a purchasing method for renting or purchasing the book, where you can put what you want in the shopping cart, and when you finish collecting the required books, you can go to the cashier, check the bill and pay it. .. In the end, this project was converted using the Flask library so that we can see the results on the web page.
